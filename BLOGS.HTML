                Desk checking is a way of testing your algorithm; it can be also called as code walk through. There 
are several ways of testing for example by showing it to peers or by implementing it into a 
programming language and just executing the code step-by-step. But desk checking is faster and it 
helps one to think like a compiler and a debugger.
